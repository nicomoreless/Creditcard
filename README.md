 In this project, I will try to use various predictive models to see how accurate they in the detection of credit card fraud


The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.

In this dataset, the credit card trasactions occured over a period of two days in which  there was 492 frauds out of 284 807 transactions.

The dataset is unbalanced, as the fraud occurence  accounts for only 0.172% of all transactions.
